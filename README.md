# EvolveWell
EvolveWell is a responsive web prototype that connects athletes with trainers. Athletes can browse or open a trainer via share link or QR code, reserve sessions, message, track progress, and buy self guided programs. Trainers set their own rates, earn ratings, and use the platform via membership.
